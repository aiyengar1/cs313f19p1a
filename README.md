Project 1A - Prints an updated "word cloud" for each sufficiently long word read from the standard input.

Problems:
- sbt test errors out in terminal (I may have messed up when adding the plugin)
- Testing suite is not complete
- Testing suite works with Java 8 but not with Java 12; has issue with importing sun.misc.Signal

Extra Credit:
Treat words case-insensitively, i.e., ignore capitalization and the like: Line 56 in Class WindowMaker
